- **Scale:** 30,000 beds provides purchasing power
- **Geographic Concentration:** Strong Midwest footprint
- **HUD Financing Access:** Long-term, favorable rates

### Growth Strategy
- Opportunistic bankruptcy/distressed acquisitions
- Portfolio roll-ups in targeted states
- Lease-to-own arrangements with struggling operators
- Turnaround operations via Legacy management

### Risk Factors
- Concentration in Midwest markets
- Regulatory scrutiny of PE-backed nursing homes
- Integration complexity with 23 operating partners
- Medicaid rate pressure in core states (IL, IA, SD)

## Query Used (Atlas)

```sql

SELECT
    c.company_name,
    pm.state,
    COUNT(DISTINCT pm.id) AS facilities,
    ROUND(AVG(mr.daily_rate), 2) AS avg_medicaid_rate

## Key Insight

**Chaim Rajchenbach's 93 facilities in Atlas represents just the Legacy Healthcare operating footprint.** Through Cascade Capital Group, he controls access to **300+ facilities with 30,000 beds across 19 states** - making this one of the largest private SNF portfolios in the United States.

The Cascade/Legacy model of separating ownership (Cascade) from operations (Legacy + 22 other partners) is a common PE-backed structure that can obscure the true scale of control when looking only at CMS operator data.
