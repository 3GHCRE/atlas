1. **Journey Healthcare Review**
   - Conduct lease compliance audit on all 8 properties

   - Consider lease termination provisions
   - Prepare for potential operator transition

2. **Harborview Health Systems**
   - Address abuse citations at Glenwood and potential others

   - Review insurance and indemnification provisions

3. **Fort Atkinson (WI)**
   - $258K fines requires immediate attention
   - Verify license status and survey history
   - Potential CMS termination risk

### Medium-Term Actions (90-180 Days)

4. **Operator Performance Standards**

   - Quarterly performance reviews tied to lease terms
   - Automatic escalation triggers for 1-star ratings

5. **Portfolio Optimization**
   - Consider transferring Journey properties to Trio Healthcare or Brickyard
   - Harborview properties may perform better under different operators
