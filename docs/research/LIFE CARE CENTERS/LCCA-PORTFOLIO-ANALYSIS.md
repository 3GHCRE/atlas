2. **Tennessee Concentration:** Deep market knowledge in home state (26 facilities)
3. **Quality Performance:** 57% of sampled facilities rated 4+ stars
4. **Low Turnover:** 38% average vs 45% industry benchmark
5. **No REIT Pressure:** Private ownership allows long-term investment focus

### Challenges

2. **Ownership Transition:** Conservatorship creates uncertainty
3. **Problem Facilities:** Several 1-2 star facilities need turnaround
4. **Florida Performance:** Largest fines concentrated in FL market

### Opportunities
1. **Third-Party Operations:** Currently only 1 property - could expand
2. **PropCo/OpCo Separation:** Could monetize real estate through sale-leaseback
3. **Market Consolidation:** Private status allows opportunistic acquisitions

### Risks
1. **Key Person Risk:** Forrest Preston's health and conservatorship
2. **Concentration Risk:** Heavy TN exposure (14.5% of portfolio)
3. **Staffing Challenges:** Several facilities with low RN coverage
