**Generated:** January 2025
**Data Source:** Atlas MCP + CMS Quality Data + Web Intelligence

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Golden Living (formerly Beverly Enterprises) is a **pure-play private landlord** that owns 156 skilled nursing facility properties across 19 states. Unlike vertically integrated operators like Life Care Centers of America, Golden Living retains real estate ownership while **30+ different third-party operators** run the facilities.

This is the legacy of a private equity restructuring following Fillmore Capital's $2.2B acquisition in 2006, which separated real estate ownership from operations.

**Key Metrics:**
- **156 properties owned** across 19 states
- **148 PropCo entities** (property-holding LLCs)
- **30+ third-party operators** running buildings
- **Only 6 principals** (lean ownership structure)
- **$2.2B acquisition value** (2006)

## INVESTMENT THESIS

### Why Pure Landlord Model?

**Advantages:**
1. **Reduced Regulatory Liability:** Operations risks transfer to tenants
2. **Stable Income:** NNN leases provide predictable cash flow
3. **Asset Appreciation:** Real estate value independent of operations
4. **Diversification:** Multiple operators reduce concentration risk
5. **Exit Flexibility:** Can sell real estate without unwinding operations

**Disadvantages:**
1. **Operator Risk:** Tenant financial distress affects rent collection
2. **Quality Control:** Limited ability to influence care quality
3. **Reputational Risk:** Poor operator performance reflects on property
4. **Lease Renewal Risk:** Operators may not renew or demand concessions

### Comparison: Golden Living vs LCCA

| Dimension | Golden Living | Life Care Centers |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Model** | Pure Landlord | Vertically Integrated |
| **Properties** | 156 owned | 179 operated |
| **Operators** | 30+ third parties | Self-operated |
| **Principals** | 6 | 480+ |
| **Control** | Lease contracts | Direct management |
| **Risk Profile** | Real estate focused | Operations focused |
| **Liability** | Lower | Higher |

## REGULATORY & LEGAL HISTORY

### Beverly Enterprises Era Issues
- DOJ/HHS Corporate Integrity Agreement (2000)
- Multiple wrongful death lawsuits (AR, CA, FL)
- Quality of care litigation

### Post-PE Restructuring
- Divestiture of operations reduced direct regulatory exposure
- Operators now bear licensure and compliance responsibility
- Real estate structure provides liability shield

---

## STRATEGIC OBSERVATIONS

### For Investors
- Pure real estate play on SNF sector
- Heavy lender concentration (Citi + Column = 55%)
- Geographic concentration risk (PA = 30%)
- Dependent on operator financial health

### For Operators
- Opportunities to lease quality buildings
- Triple-net structure requires strong balance sheet
- Potential acquisition targets as Golden Living may sell

### For Competitors
- Model for separating real estate from operations
- PE exit strategy case study
- Shows path from operator to landlord
