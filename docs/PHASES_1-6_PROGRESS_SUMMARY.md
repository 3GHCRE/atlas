2. **Family Networks:** Documented relationships (Herzka, Rajchenbach patterns)

3. **Co-ownership Structures:** Mapped complete ownership percentages across major networks

4. **REIT Structures:** Documented public REIT leadership (Strawberry Fields REIT)

5. **Acquisition Vehicles:** Documented acquisition structures (DAC Acquisition, MCS Plan)
