## Transaction Structure Analysis

### Why Internal Restructuring?

1. **Refinancing**: The $133.7M MonticelloAM bridge loan suggests debt restructuring
2. **Entity Separation**: Moving from operating entities (SMV) to property-holding entities (Propco)
3. **Tax Optimization**: REIT-like structure separating real estate from operations
4. **Balance Sheet**: Resetting property basis for accounting purposes

### Financing Details

| Component | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Bridge Loan | $133.7M |
| Term | 36 months + 2 extensions |
| Lender | MonticelloAM Funding SH-89-A LLC |
| Security | Cross-collateralized across portfolio |

## Similar Transactions in Database

The broader NC sale activity shows ~$407M in total recorded transactions including:

- Wallace, Eden, Wilson, Clayton, Yanceyville facilities (SMV → NC Propco)
- Universal Health Care properties (Universal Properties → address-named LLCs)
- River Bend (Baptist Retirement Homes → Cascade Capital)

## Data Quality Notes

- Transaction data from REAPI commercial records
- Entity ownership traced through CMS enrollment and state registrations
- Address matching confirmed Portopiccolo control of both buyer and seller entities
- MonticelloAM financing confirmed via company press releases

---

## Implications

1. **Not a Market Transaction**: Should not be used as a comparable for market valuations
2. **Debt Play**: Primary purpose appears to be refinancing/restructuring debt
3. **Continued Ownership**: Portopiccolo retains full control of these assets
4. **Operator Continuity**: Same management brands (Accordius, Pelican) continue operating
