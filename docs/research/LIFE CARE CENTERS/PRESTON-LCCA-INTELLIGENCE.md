## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Life Care Centers of America (LCCA), the largest privately-held nursing home chain in the United States, underwent a historic ownership control transition in March 2025. Founder Forrest L. Preston (age 91, $1.2B net worth) was placed under permanent conservatorship following allegations of financial exploitation and abuse by his third wife, Kim Phuong Nguyen Preston. Control of the $3B+ revenue enterprise has transferred to Preston's son, Aubrey Preston.

This marks the first time in 54 years that control of LCCA has passed from Forrest Preston to another party.
